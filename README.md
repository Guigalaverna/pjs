## What is PJS?

PJS or Project Setup is a script for setting up a project using templates build in YAML. I wrote this script because I was tired of typing the same commands over and over again and I wanted to be able to quickly set up a project without waiting for the templates created by frameworks's developers to be ready.

So, I choose use YAML as a format for storing the templates because it is easy to read and easy to write.

## How to write a template/setups?

All the templates are stored in a YAML file in `~/.config/pjs/setups.yaml`, and the file is automatically loaded when you run `pjs`.

### Structure of the file

```yaml
- name: <name of the setup> # Optional but recommended
  alias: <alias> # Required
  steps:
    - description: <description of the step> # Required
      command: <command> # Required
    - description: <description of the step> # Required
      command: <command> # Required
```

## How to use PJS?

You can use PJS by typing the following command:

```bash
pjs <alias> <project name>
```

### Arguments

| Argument         | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<alias>`        | The alias of the template you want to use, configured in `~/.config/pjs/setups.yaml` |
| `<project name>` | The name of the project you want to create.                                          |

### Observations

- The script will be create a project in current directory, so, if you run the script in `~/`, the project will be created in `~/<project name>`.

- If you prefer to use "options with arguments", you can use the following command:

  | Option                |
  | --------------------- |
  | `--alias`, `-a`       |
  | `--projectName`, `-p` |
